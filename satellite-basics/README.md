# Basic IBM Cloud Satellite Deployment on the Edge

## Introduction to IBM Cloud Satellite

In this IBM Cloud Satellite walkthrough, we will be showing you how to deploy a sample application on to a Satellite device. IBM Cloud Satellite allows you to deploy and run applications across on-premises, edge computing, and public cloud environments from any cloud vendor.

**Why is this important?**

Satellite allows you to:

* Consume public cloud in your data center
  * Bring the flexibility and agility of public cloud services to your secure on-premises data center. Build new apps quickly, while maintaining strong regulatory controls. 
* Get real-time analytics at the edge
  * Process data where it's generated to reduce latency for immediate action. Expand to new locations instantly and manage it all from a single console. 
* Control where workloads run 
  * Tame application sprawl and run workloads consistently, wherever they are needed. Know what applications are running where and when while you improve auditability. 
* Bring AI to your data
  * Use a consistent set of data and AI services across all your environments. Bring analytics tools to your data to reduce latency, to reduce data egress charges, and to meet residency requirements.
